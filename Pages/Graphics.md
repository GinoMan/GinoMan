## Steam Grids ##

I created these grids in GIMP because I could not find steam grids for them online. Very little of what's in these grids represents my own artwork, instead, I used GIMP to combine freely available assets on the internet to create the final image. At times I had to carve the logo itself out of the image, at other points, I had to fix spotty graphics myself. For some, only some cropping and filling in was required while for others I had to generate backgrounds from scratch using gradients and fills.

### To Leave ###

To Leave, the game, was missing grids but the makers had created several wallpapers for desktop backgrounds and the logo wasn't difficult to carve out from the graphics. Once I had it carved out, I combined the logo with the wallpapers to create these grids.

## Social Media Banners ##

I created these banners to help my church advertise their small groups on social media.

## UI Design ##

### Billable Call Recorder ###

This UI was built to log phone calls and the machines they were associated with for billing purposes.

## Diagrams ##

I generated this diagram for everyone confused by the documentation for VSCode Snippet Tabstops (including myself). The documentation used to create this diagram is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). I used this online generator: [Railroad Diagram Generator](https://railroad.omegatower.net/index.html). The code fed to the generator is [here](/Assets/Diagrams/vscode-snippets.js).

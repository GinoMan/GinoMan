<td rowspan="2"><h4>Rewriting The Super Metroid Bizhawk Script</h4>
My Bizhawk script for Super Metroid while cool is getting long in the tooth. The API has been updated in Bizhawk in ways that makes how I had to design my script before obsolete. The new script will be almost a full rewrite. Calls into the game's memory will be more performant, Game states will be further analyzed and given names on the screen, I've not decided whether to add icons instead of keeping the text icons for pickups, and other various improvements are planned.</td>

# Ask me about #

Technology Consulting. I can provide the knowledge and the technology to take your business to the next level and drive conversions to you through internet marketing and online presence. Having a website is great and if you don't have one, you should, but it's not very helpful if people cannot find your business when they search "your product near me". It's even less helpful if that site doesn't set them up to make a purchase (whether that's scheduling your time for a service, or buying a product you offer in store to be shipped to them).

And that's just one side of the equation. The other side is setting yourself up for success by implementing technologies that streamlines your operations so that you can reduce overhead costs and customer disappointments.

# My Approach to Programming #

- Completion: The project isn't done unless the code is documented, tested, and flexible.
- Proven Design Principles: I adhere to proven design principles in a judicious manner. These include SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, and similar advice.
- Outside In: I create new software from the outside in, first considering all of the libraries, inputs, outputs, and UI needed to make the program work, and then write the core logic to connect these components together.
- Speak the Language: I don't write assembly in Java, I don't write C++ in Python. Learning a programming language means learning not just its components, its libraries, and its syntax, but also its idioms.
- Building on the work: As programmers, we stand on the shoulders of the engineers who came before us. Proven solutions to problems are better than rolling our own, and most of the problems we face as programmers have been solved before by other programmers.

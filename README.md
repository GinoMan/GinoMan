My Bizhawk script for Super Metroid while cool is getting long in the tooth. The API has been updated in Bizhawk in ways that makes how I had to design my script before obsolete. The new script will be almost a full rewrite. Calls into the game's memory will be more performant, Game states will be further analyzed and given names on the screen, I've not decided whether to add icons instead of keeping the text icons for pickups, and other various improvements are planned.</td>

# Ask me about #

Technology Consulting. I can provide the knowledge and the technology to take your business to the next level and drive conversions to you through internet marketing and online presence. Having a website is great and if you don't have one, you should, but it's not very helpful if people cannot find your business when they search "your product near me". It's even less helpful if that site doesn't set them up to make a purchase (whether that's scheduling your time for a service, or buying a product you offer in store to be shipped to them).

And that's just one side of the equation. The other side is setting yourself up for success by implementing technologies that streamlines your operations so that you can reduce overhead costs and customer disappointments.

All of these things however are at your fingertips with me to enrich your business and make the long term cost more than worth it. I provide...

- Your very own professional domain name
- A wordpress website set up to drive conversions for your business while empowering you to make your own content as you wish, including hosting, developing, and ongoing updates.
- Professional email systems that are unique for your business and establish an online identity
- Social Media marketing that drives people to you and not your competitors
- Search Engine Optimization that increases the likelihood that prospective customers will find you first.
- Full branding for your business or social media channel: Video Thumbnails, Logos, Print graphics, Motion Graphics, Stingers, Software and Hardware consulting, Color Theming, Marketing, and Descriptions.
- Copywriting that compels people to buy from you
- Bespoke technology services that streamline your business
- Software Integrations
- Graphic design that makes you stand out from the crowd
- Clear and concise documentation that educates users effectively to receive the most value out of your products or services
- Custom made software tools that streamline internal processes

# My Approach to Programming #

- Completion: The project isn't done unless the code is documented, tested, and flexible.
- Proven Design Principles: I adhere to proven design principles in a judicious manner. These include SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, and similar advice.
- Outside In: I create new software from the outside in, first considering all of the libraries, inputs, outputs, and UI needed to make the program work, and then write the core logic to connect these components together.
- Speak the Language: I don't write assembly in Java, I don't write C++ in Python. Learning a programming language means learning not just its components, its libraries, and its syntax, but also its idioms.
- Building on the work: As programmers, we stand on the shoulders of the engineers who came before us. Proven solutions to problems are better than rolling our own, and most of the problems we face as programmers have been solved before by other programmers.

## Steam Grids ##

I created these grids in GIMP because I could not find steam grids for them online. Very little of what's in these grids represents my own artwork, instead, I used GIMP to combine freely available assets on the internet to create the final image. At times I had to carve the logo itself out of the image, at other points, I had to fix spotty graphics myself.

### To Leave ###

To Leave, the game, was missing grids but the makers had created several wallpapers for the computer desktop and the logo wasn't difficult to carve out from the graphics. Once I had it carved out, I combined the logo with the wallpapers to create these grids.

## Social Media Banners ##

I created these banners to help my church advertise their small groups on social media.

- The Great Commission - "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
- Isaiah 9 - For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

# My Approach to Programming #

- Completion: The project isn't done unless the code is documented, tested, and flexible.
- Proven Design Principles: I adhere to proven design principles in a judicious manner. These include SOLID, DRY, YAGNI,
and similar advice.
- Outside In: I create new software from the outside in, first considering all of the libraries, inputs, outputs, and UI needed to
make the program work, and then write the core logic to connect these components together.
- Speak the Language: I don't write assembly in Java, I don't write C++ in Python. Learning a programming language means learning
not just its components, its libraries, and its syntax, but also its idioms.
- Building on the work: As programmers, we stand on the shoulders of the engineers who came before us. Proven solutions to
problems are better than rolling our own, and most of the problems we face as programmers have been solved before by other programmers.

## Steam Grids ##

I created these grids in GIMP because I could not find steam grids for them online. Very little of what's in these grids represents my own artwork, instead, I used GIMP to combine freely available assets on the internet to create the final image. At times I had to carve the logo itself out of the image, at other points, I had to fix spotty graphics myself.

### To Leave ###

To Leave, the game, was missing grids but the makers had created several wallpapers for the computer desktop and the logo wasn't difficult to carve out from the graphics. Once I had it carved out, I combined the logo with the wallpapers to create these grids.

## Social Media Banners ##

I created these banners to help my church advertise their small groups on social media.

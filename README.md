### Grids ###

I created these grids in GIMP because I could not find steam grids for them online. Very little of what's in these grids represents my own artwork, instead, I used the editor to combine freely available assets on the internet to create the final image.

## UI Design

### Billable Call Recorder ###

This UI was built to log phone calls and the machines they were associated with for billing purposes.

# My Approach to Programming #

- Completion: The project isn't done unless the code is documented, tested, and flexible.
- Proven Design Principles: I adhere to proven design principles in a judicious manner. These include SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, and similar advice.
- Outside In: I create new software from the outside in, first considering all of the libraries, inputs, outputs, and UI needed to make the program work, and then write the core logic to connect these components together.
- Speak the Language: I don't write assembly in Java, I don't write C++ in Python. Learning a programming language means learning not just its components, its libraries, and its syntax, but also its idioms.
- Building on the work: As programmers, we stand on the shoulders of the engineers who came before us. Proven solutions to problems are better than rolling our own, and most of the problems we face as programmers have been solved before by other programmers.
